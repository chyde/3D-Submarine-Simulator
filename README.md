## About  

I made this in college for my Senior Project team to see if we could skip having to put our sub in the pool to test out the AI. 

I learned a LOT about 3D graphics making this and I really enjoyed it.  I am keeping this project here to exemplify what I 
learned (on my own) in a very short amount of time.  This was one of my first ever js projects and an early code project to be sure.
I have since gone on to create other graphical things, and games, but this one is still special to me.
